\chapter{Hyperparameter Space}\label{apdx: hyper space}
In this chapter, we present the hyperparameter space we search for the models we trained in our experiment. Note that for tasks in different frequencies, the hyperparameter space we search are different. This is because time series with different frequencies essentially operates in different space. The forecasting tasks are thus differentiated by the frequencies as well.
