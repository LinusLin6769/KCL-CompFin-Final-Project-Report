    We propose and evaluate Directional Change Transformation (DCT). DCT is a novel target transformation method for time series forecasting based on the Directional Change Intrinsic Time Framework. DCT has several interesting features. First, it has denoising and smoothing ability while capturing the extreme events in time series. Secondly, it has feature generation ability which can be seen as a characterisation of time series. Thirdly, DCT is parameterised in such a way that it is very flexible and can enable tremendous customisation. Based on our large-scale experiment, we find that applying DCT can help improve model performance in forecasting tasks.
